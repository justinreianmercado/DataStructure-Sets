# DataStructure-Sets

This program is aimed to demonstrate my understanding of the following concepts:

File handling (input and output) \n
Use of public C++ libraries such as forward_lists, unordered_map
Operator overloading
Object Oriented Programming
Set datatype functions (add, contains, remove, union, difference, intersection, traverse, filter, size)
Vectors
Template data type
This program will prompt for an input file and will generate an output file ("output.txt") with results from user executed commands in the IDE.

Debug code has been intentionally left in and commented out to provide logic process and debugging resources for further development in the future
