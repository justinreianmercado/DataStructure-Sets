# DataStructure - Sets
## This program will manipulate template data using Set Datatype

**This program is aimed to demonstrate my understanding of the following concepts:**
- File handling (input and output)
- Use of public C++ libraries such as forward_lists, unordered_map
- Operator overloading
- Object Oriented Programming
- Set datatype functions (add, contains, remove, union, difference, intersection, traverse, filter, size)
- Vectors
- Templates

**This program will prompt for an input file and will generate an output file ("output.txt") with results from user executed commands in the IDE.

*Debug code has been intentionally left in and commented out to provide logic process and debugging resources for further development in the future*
